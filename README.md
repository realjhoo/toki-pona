toki pona sitelen practice

I wanted to practice identifying toki pona sitelen glyphs, 
so I built this simple app to do just that. It isnt at all fancy.
It simply chooses a random word-glyph or compound-glyph and asks you
to choose the correct Toki Pona word from a 4 choice list.
If you are correct, the answer is marked green, and your score 
increases. If you are incorrect, the answer is marked red, and a point 
is deducted. You may try again, if you wish.

The text of the page appears, including the control surfaces, 
the instructions and the copyright notice, are all in Toki Pona,
either in glyph or Latin alphabet form. These words and phrases may be
horribly wrong. Working on that.
