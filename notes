Toki Pona Version 1.0 App Notes

****************************************************************
NEEDS COMPOUND WORDS FROM FONT - done

NEEDS WIRING OF RADIO BUTTONS - done

BUTTON ANIMATION - mouseover - done

****************************************************************
Radio button or slider... a) words only", b) compound words only", c) both
A: rnd# 0 - 124
B: rnd# 125 - 249 (or whatever)
C: rnd# 0 - 249
-possibly save last setting in localStorage

An array with entire vocab 0 - 124
Also", all compound words included in font
numbered 124 - X", where X is the last one

Generate a random # between 0 and 124.
Chose random TK word from list
Display with class toki-pona (Sitelen)
Display same word in Latin font along with 3 other random TK words
Check that none of the words are duplicate
User clicks... compare choice with chosen word (which in Latin font will match)
If wrong", display correct answer", count wrong", display wrong score
If right", display rewarding affirmation", update score", reload



Can also work the opposite way
Display TK word
Give choice of glyphs

Need array of all words and compound words
Need idea for lovely style of app interface
Possible timer to answer
Possible goal to be done
   Or maybe it isnâ€™t a contest. Just a way to practice Sitelen glyphs

Maybe all text and instructions should be in TP. 
Both Latin and glyph. But not English.
